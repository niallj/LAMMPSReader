LAMMPSReader reads LAMMPS dump files, both in text and binary format.

Binary File Format
------------------

This is the version used the the 15/08/2013 LAMMPS release.

Type		Length (bytes)		Field			Explanation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
bigint		8			timestep		Self-explanatory
bigint		8			ndump			Number of atoms in the dump
int		4			triclinic		1 if a triclinic box, 0 otherwise

int		4			boundary xlo		***********************************
int		4			boundary xhi		* 0 = periodic			   *
int		4			boundary ylo		* 1 = fixed			   *
int		4			boundary yhi		* 2 = shrink wrapped		   *
int		4			boundary zlo		* 3 = shrink-wrapped with minimum * 
int		4			boundary zhi		***********************************

double		8			xlo			As in plaintext dump file
double		8			xhi			"
double		8			ylo			"
double		8			yhi			"
double		8			zlo			"
double		8			zhi			"

double		8			tilt xy			Triclinic tilt factors
double		8			tilt xz			Only appear if a triclinic box
double		8			tilt yz			Not read by LAMMPSReader, which can't use triclinic boxes

int		4			size_one		Number of fields per atom

int		4			nprocs/nclusterprocs	Either the total number of processors, or the number which wrote the binary file.

int		4			buffersize		Number of bytes to follow for each atom

ndump * size_one doubles will then appear, with each double representing one field for one atom. The fields will appear in the same order that you specified them in the dump command.
When invoking ReadFrame() on a binary file, the argument string MUST specify ALL fields in the file. For example, if you create a dump file with the command: `dump track all custom 1 track.lammpstrj.bin id type x y z vx vy vz`, then the call to ReadFrame must take the form ReadFrame("id type x y z vx vy vz", c);. It is not possible to select a subset of the avilable properties, as it is with text files.
